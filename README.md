# Spotify Clone ðŸŽ§

![Hero Page Image](https://github.com/anav5704/spotify-clone/blob/main/docs/spotify.png)

This is a simple, full-stack Spotify clone but without premium. Users can add their own music to their library and this will be available to all signed-in users. Users can also like songs and search for songs. If you open up the site and it seems broken, that's my backend being suspended. Send me a [message](https://www.instagram.com/partially_unblind) and I'll resume it. Free tiers can only take you so far.

## Technologies Used

- Next JS 13
- TailwindCSS
- Radix UI
- Supabase 
- Zustand

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a ```.env.local``` file in the root of your project with the following variables(these are from your Supabase project):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

Once that is done, run ```npm run dev``` to view it on localhost.
