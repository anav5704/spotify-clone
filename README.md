# Spotify Clone ðŸŽ§

![Hero Page Image](https://github.com/anav5704/spotify-clone/blob/main/docs/hero.png)

This is a full-stack Spotify clone but without premium. Users can add their own music to their library and this will be available to all signed-in users. Users can also like songs and search for songs. If you open up the site and it seems broken, that's my backend being suspended. Send me a [dm](https://www.instagram.com/) and I'll resume it. Free tiers can only take you so far.
